          <h3>Social Events</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the year, we hold social events such as lunches, study
            breaks, mixers, bowling nights, and random outings. We regularly
            host a study break or Christmas party after classes end. In the past
            study breaks, we have had activities such as cookie decorating
            contest, gift exchange, video games, trivia, prizes and swag
            giveaways. We also host a movie night once a semester.

          <h3>Hackathons</h3>
          <p>
            Rice CS Club hosts a yearly student-led hackathon named
            <a href="{{ hack_rice.link }}">HackRice</a>. During the hackathon
            people get together and collaboratively code in an extreme manner
            over the span of a day or two to build amazing projects!
          </p>
          <p>
            It's simple: Code, Eat, Sleep for the entire weekend and see what
            you come up with. We'll take care of the eating part.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the hackathon, participants demonstrate their
            applications to the audience and a panel of judges for a chance to
            win prizes.
          </p>
